# Analysing-Array-of-Quantum-low-dimensional-networks
In this section we have analysed various low dimensional networks using Tight binding greenâ€™s function approach. Different systems like Axially &amp; transversely coupled diamond array, fibbonacci like diamond array, basic mesoscopic rings and other systems.
